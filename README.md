  ## Description

  
   I wanted to be able to better understand PWA's and how they are built and how webpack can be used to create a PWA and keep information and application persistent even without any connection. PWA can operate offline making that useful for certain application and solving that problem if your application is a vital part of a process and having it go down due to network issues can cause a lot of frustration. Using a PWA is a great option for applications that need to run always and may at times not have network to run off of.
